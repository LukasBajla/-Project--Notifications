# Notifications Page [Frontend Mentor Challenge]

![Design preview for the Notifications page coding challenge](./assets/thumbnail/thmbn%20_notifications.png)

-- The initial design and documentation are from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) --

## Overview

This is a mockup of a notifications page, mainly featuring an 'unread' state that , for the purpose of this mockup, can be toggled on or off.

To simulate the 'unread' function, `upon clicking on the user's name that particular notification will be switched to an 'unread' state`. Clicking on the user name again will remove the 'unread' state, or to clear all 'unread' notifications, press the "Mark all as read" button at the top of the page.
